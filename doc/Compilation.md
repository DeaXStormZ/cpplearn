# Compilation

## Static

all the libraries are linked at compile time. the executable keeps its own copy of all libraries code

## Shared

all the libraries are compiled, and at runtime it links with the different files.
can be a little slower, but more convenient to just update one lib, or for multiple programs using same libraries to reduce space

## inline

## Headers (.h)

dans header
mettre template definition
mettre functions inline
ifndef ...
define ...
include uniquement ce qui est utile ds le header
